i want the workflows under customer experience to work like this,in essence I want them to be stricter I dont want the llm opening things to interpretation


-Passenger Harassment/Rude Behaviour 
When this option is picked I want a drop down of the following to be picked 
Threats
Verbal Abuse 
Physical Abuse 
Stalking 
Inappropriate behaviour 

After this I want a message displayed telling how sorry we are and this goes against Grab's values,we value customer safety etc and we will do our best to report and follow up with this 

I want a prompt displayed for the user to enter in both text and image format a description of what happened 

After this I want you to display a set of helplines and display another apology and assure a speedy resolution 

I want this built for customer side as driver is harassing and on the driver side as well as driver is harassing
